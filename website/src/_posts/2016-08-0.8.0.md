Hello there! Writing to let you know that we have released Uppy 0.8.0. Among with a bunch of under the hood improvements and refactors, we have also managed to teach Uppy a few neat and important new tricks, and we are quite proud of that.

## Meta Data

While fetching your files for you, Uppy can also supply some custom metadata to go along with them. So far there are three components in place for that: Core API (`core:update-meta` event), `MetaData` plugin and a new panel in Dashboard UI called File Card, which looks cool like this:

<img alt="metadata dashboard UI, editing file name, future size and adding description" src="/images/blog/metadata-dashboard.jpg" class="border">

And to summon it, you click on the edit button on the Dashboard:

<img alt="metadata dashboard UI, editing file name, future size and adding description" src="/images/blog/uppy-dashboard-ui.jpg" class="border">

By default, the only meta data field there is `Name`. But, if you want to add some other fields — fear not! That’s what the `MetaData` plugin is for:

```javascript
const uppy = new Uppy()
  .use(Dashboard)
  .use(MetaData, {
    fields: [
      { id: 'resizeTo', name: 'Resize to', value: 1200, placeholder: 'specify future image size' },
      { id: 'description', name: 'Description', value: '', placeholder: 'describe what the file is for' }
    ]
  })
```

And just like that, we’ve added two fields: `Resize` and `Description`. The metadata is passed with both tus and multipart uploads.

## Webcam

We’ve added a basic `Webcam` plugin which let’s you acquire images from, you know. We are going to improve it in the next release.

## Mime Types and File Icons

Uppy now includes a [mime-type](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mime-types) library that helps us figure out file type by extension.

With proper file types come file icons for the Dashboard UI. We’ve added a few and will supply some more for audio, video, text, PDF and other common ones.

## Previously on Uppy: File Previews, Remote File Handling, Accessibility and Acceptance Tests Stats

We thought it’s worth taking a moment to list a few highlights from the previous versions as well:

* If a file you selected is an image, it’s preview thumbnail data url will be generated and added to `file.preview` in Uppy’s state and that can be later used to render a preview with any plugin, which is currently done by the mighty Dashboard.
* It is now also possible to select remote files in Uppy. Simply double-click a file from, for instance, Google Drive, and Uppy will then show it in a preview area. Good boy, Uppy!
* We have been doing some more work on accessibility: from now on, when you switch tabs in Modal, it will focus on the first input in that tab. We’ve also added proper labels and titles, and are doing more research in this area.
* Everybody likes to see stats. That is why, on our website, you can now [view stats]((http://uppy.io/stats)) that show how acceptance tests are performing in various browsers. If a test is successful, that means Uppy will likely be able to load and upload files in that particular browser.
* Dashboard UI is now way cooler and easier to work with. It replaced the old `Modal` plugin, it can accept files via drag drop, local disk and paste (experimental, WIP), so it becomes our main source of truth + basic acquire plugin for local files. DragDrop plugin is still available as a lighter alternative.
